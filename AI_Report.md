# AI Usage Report - Streaming Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a streaming service dashboard (Netflix/Hulu clone) built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API and displays it in a modern, responsive interface.

## AI Tool Usage

### Primary AI Assistant: Auto (Cursor AI)

The entire project was developed with assistance from Cursor's AI assistant (Auto). The AI was used for:

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Set up configuration files (tsconfig.json, next.config.js, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js)
   - Configured Git ignore file

2. **TypeScript Type Definitions**
   - Created comprehensive type interfaces for Movie and MovieDetail
   - Defined API response types

3. **API Integration**
   - Implemented TMDB API helper functions in `lib/tmdb.ts`
   - Set up server-side data fetching with proper error handling
   - Configured Next.js image optimization for TMDB image domains

4. **Component Development**
   - **Header Component**: Navigation bar with responsive design
   - **HeroBanner Component**: Featured movie banner with gradient overlay
   - **MovieCard Component**: Reusable movie poster card with hover effects
   - **MovieRow Component**: Horizontal scrolling movie rows
   - All components include proper TypeScript typing and accessibility features

5. **Page Development**
   - **Homepage (app/page.tsx)**: Server component with parallel data fetching
   - **Movie Detail Page (app/movie/[id]/page.tsx)**: Dynamic route with comprehensive movie information display

6. **Styling & Design**
   - Implemented dark theme with Tailwind CSS
   - Added responsive breakpoints for mobile and desktop
   - Created smooth animations and transitions
   - Implemented gradient overlays and hover effects

7. **Documentation**
   - Generated comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
   - Created this AI usage report

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- AI assisted in creating the complete Next.js project structure
- Configured all necessary dependencies and build tools
- Set up TypeScript and Tailwind CSS integration

### Phase 2: Core Development
- AI generated TypeScript interfaces based on TMDB API structure
- Created reusable components following React best practices
- Implemented server-side rendering for optimal performance

### Phase 3: Features & Polish
- AI helped implement responsive design patterns
- Added accessibility features (alt text, semantic HTML)
- Optimized images using Next.js Image component

### Phase 4: Documentation
- AI generated comprehensive README with deployment instructions
- Created this usage report documenting the development process

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Server-Side Rendering**: All data fetching happens on the server for better performance
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all components and API responses
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
4. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing and lazy loading
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error states for API failures
6. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, alt text, and proper ARIA labels

## AI Assistance Summary

The AI assistant was instrumental in:
- Generating boilerplate code and project structure
- Providing TypeScript type definitions
- Implementing React component patterns
- Creating responsive CSS with Tailwind
- Writing documentation and setup instructions
- Debugging and optimizing code

## Notes

- All code follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
